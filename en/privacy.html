		<h2>3. General notes and mandatory information</h2>
		<h3>Data privacy</h3>

		<div style="display: block;padding: 12px 16px;">
			We, the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften e.V. (MPG), Hofgartenstraße 8, D-80539 Munich, Germany, phone: +49 (89) 2108-0, operate this site and the following social media websites:<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Twitter: <a style="color:rgb(78, 111, 156)" href="https://twitter.com/B3D_NRW" target="_blank"><b>twitter.com/B3D_NRW</b></a></li>
				<li>LinkedIn: <a style="color:rgb(78, 111, 156)" href="https://de.linkedin.com/showcase/big-bang-to-big-data" target="_blank"><b>de.linkedin.com/showcase/big-bang-to-big-data</b></a></li>
			</ul><br>
			As the operator of these pages, we, the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften e.V., are jointly responsible with the operator of the respective social media platform within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO):<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (LinkedIn)</li>
				<li>Twitter International Company (Twitter)</li>
			</ul><br>
			When visiting our social media websites, personal data is processed by the responsible parties. In the following, we will inform you about what data is involved, how it is processed and what rights you have in this regard. As the responsible party for these pages, we have entered into agreements with the operator of the respective social media platform, which regulate, among other things, the conditions for use of the pages. The terms of use of the respective operator and the other conditions and guidelines listed there at the end are authoritative.
		</div>

		<p>The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>
		<h3>Duration of storage</h3>
		<p>Unless a more specific storage period has been stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted after these reasons no longer apply.</p>
		<h3>Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries</h3>
		<p>Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.&nbsp;g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.</p>
		<h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
		<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
		<h3>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 DSGVO)</h3>
		<p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21 (1) DSGVO).</p>
		<p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS CONNECTED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) DSGVO).</p>
		<h3>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h3>
		<p>In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
		<h3>Right to data portability</h3>
		<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>
		<h3>Information, deletion and correction</h3>
		<p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
		<h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
		<p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
		<li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.</li>
		<li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
		<li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
		<h2>4. Data collection on this website</h2>
		<h3>Cookies</h3>
		<p>Our Internet pages use so-called "cookies". Cookies are small text files and do not cause any damage to your terminal device. They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device. Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself&nbsp;or until they are automatically deleted by your web browser.</p>
		<p>In some cases, cookies from third-party companies may also be stored on your terminal device when you enter our site (third-party cookies). These enable us or you to use certain services of the third-party company (e.g. cookies for processing payment services).</p>
		<p>Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g. the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies are used to evaluate user behavior&nbsp;or to display advertising.</p>
		<p>Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic communication process (necessary cookies) or to provide certain functions that you have requested (functional cookies, e.&nbsp;g. for the shopping cart function) or to optimize the website (e.&nbsp;g. cookies to measure the web audience) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent to store cookies has been requested, the cookies in question are stored exclusively on the basis of this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO); consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
		<p>You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. When deactivating cookies, the functionality of this website may be limited.</p>
		<p>If cookies are used by third-party companies or for analysis purposes, we will inform you about this separately within the framework of this data protection declaration and, if necessary, request your consent.</p>
